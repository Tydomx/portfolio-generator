# Portfolio-generator

## This project was built to have users generate their own personalized website in just a few steps using Node.js without the hassle of using all the boilerplate and typing to get everything set-up. It's all been set up for you!

Things I've learned while creating this project: 
- Learned how to export data from one file to another, so that they work together asynchronously.
- Learned more about using promises and how it works to create asynchronous code allowing for a better functioning website.
- Learned the usage of efficiency of ES6. (Very useful)
  - Like the arrow functions
  - Or Const/Let

## Challenges faced:
- Bugs where I did a callback on the wrong function and had things incorrectly popping up.
- Had another challenge where my app was not allowing the user to type anything after being called.  
  - This issue was resolved when I did another pass through my code to see the issue, and found that I was calling the wrong function.

## Installation
- Assuming you've found this README already. 
- Go ahead and clone this onto your computer
- Afterward make sure to have the latest Node.js installed onto your computer
- Once those are finished go ahead and type 'node app' to activate the program
- From here just follow the instructions given
- Once instructions have been given and the messages {ok: true, message: 'File created!'} has shown
- Go to the dist folder and open up the index.html file that was created in the folder.
- Enjoy your new portfolio site! :)
